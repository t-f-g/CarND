# Rubric Points
## Implementation - The PID procedure follows what was taught in the lessons.
Implementation mimics lessons and in particular David's walkthrough https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YamBuzDjrs8&feature=youtu.be

## Reflection - Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.
The effects of P, I and D are what I expected.  A large P parameter has the immediate effect of compensating/reacting to the observed error.  The D parameter was useful in reducing the overcompensation/overshoot.

## Reflection - Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.
I began with David's drunken car parameters:

P = -0.5, I = 0, D = -0.5

and started reducing them in magnitude.

P = -0.25, I = 0, D = -0.25

P = -0.15, I = 0, D = -0.15

P = -0.09, I = 0, D = -0.09

and quickly noticed the steering reaction isn't strong enough and the dampening hasn't gotten any better, so the magnitude must be enough, but the proportion of the D value to the P must be made larger, so I started with a factor of 10.

P = -0.18, I = 0, D = -1.8

This showed strong improvements but there were still issues on the straight section (the bridge), so the steering was too strong and the overshoot needed to be controlled by increasing the D parameter again.

P = -0.13, I = 0, D = -1.9

P = -0.12, I = 0, D = -2.1

This steadily improved until I had a strong enough steering to catch the two hard turns in the track and enough to control the majority of the overshoot.

P = -0.11, I = 0, D = -2.1

These final parameters were added to [run.sh](run.sh)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
